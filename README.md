# Bluetooth PTT Driver

Built from the code for [SimpleBluetoothLeTerminal](https://github.com/kai-morich/SimpleBluetoothLeTerminal) and [SimpleBluetoothTerminal](https://github.com/kai-morich/SimpleBluetoothTerminal) by Kai Morich, this app allows for dynamically connecting Bluetooth RSM (remote speaker mic) and PTT buttons to app functions through the use of Android Intents using driver definitions.

## Driver Definition

Drivers are individual JSON files with a single object containing key/value pairs. (Definition documentation coming soon.)
